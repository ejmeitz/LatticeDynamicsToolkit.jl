# Lattice Dynamics Toolkit

Anharmonic lattice dynamics routines. Force constant format and many implementations are copied from the TDEP code. I do not gurantee feature parity to TDEP though.

Features:
----------
- Read IFCs
- Remap IFCs to supercell
- Calculate effective Hamiltonian energies
- Generate canonical configurations
    - Calculate Hamiltonian energies and/or LAMMPS supported potential on the fly


Plans:
-------
- GPU support
